# Fake-News-Detector
https://news--detection.streamlit.app
*A machine learning project for classifying news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and TF-IDF vectorization.*

# 📌 Overview

# This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate building a fake news classifier using text feature extraction (TF-IDF) and machine learning models. The goal is to preprocess news text, extract meaningful features, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance.

# This project is intended for learning and experimentation in NLP-based fake news detection.

#🚀 Features

✔ Preprocessing of news text data
✔ Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer
✔ Model training     
✔ Jupyter Notebooks to explore steps interactively
✔ Easy for experimentation and learning

#🧠 How It Works

Data Loading
Load dataset of news articles labeled as fake or real.

Text Preprocessing
Clean and normalize text (lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords, etc.).

TF-IDF Vectorization
Convert text into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF.

Model Training
Train a classification model (Linear Support Vector Classification) to distinguish fake from real articles.

# 🧪 Running the Project
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open and run the notebooks:
1: Fake News tfidf.ipynb
2: Fake News.ipynb

#📈 Results
Each notebook includes visualization and evaluation of the trained machine learning model. Metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance indicators help understand how well the model is classifying news articles.
